### Microservice VS Monolith

What are common pitfalls when dealing with Microservices? Is it all-around solution for all problems ever or there are different approaches to try-out before jumping on the bandwagon? How to scale otherwise and how to utilize advancements which microservice archicteture brings to the table? One thing is for sure, the team topologies must follow microservice desings.
We went through several desings and established common understanding that there could be multiple ownership patterns, but that having ownership over microservice is crucial in this constellation.

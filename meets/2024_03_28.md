## Topics

### Client/Server Autogenerated REST Interfaces

We talked about [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) generators and how those can be applied in building pipelines. Is it a good practice to commit generated classes or to generate them each time before compliling. How those tools make life easier and when to work with mustache adjustments. What are the most common options used when configuring [generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/csharp/) and which http libraries are used for generated clients?

### Identity / Auth

What are the most common services or platforms used for Authentication and Authorization? What was the current state of Microsoft Identity Server and what's the integrated dotnet solution for it? What happened with Auth0 and what was the replacement. We tackled complex examples where Authroization has to follow tree structure of defined access rights. How to synchronize such system with the changes in tree structure or where to place the authorization check when protecting service? Is the ACL part of Authorization at all? How the mediator helps here?
